            <p>Typically, I love listening to music throughout the day. I feel as if it gives me a good pep in my step to take on the day. Music has been very soothing lately. </p>

            <p>I love watching videos while either doing work, or when I am eating or relaxing. It helps me get through assignments or my work easier. I can do more things efficiently and be more productive while listening to videos. </p>

            <p>I have been in crossfit for about 5 years now and I have immersed myself in the sport. I am always on this website, checking for new news, to hear the latest updates with different workouts and or athletes. I like to be in the now. </p>

            <p>For some odd reason, I enjoy looking at my apple maps and looking at different locations. Currently, I have a new project in my studio class, and I have been checking the location via Apple Maps. </p>

            <p>I typically catch myself on reeddit now. I find it very funny, and I have more fun on it than other types of social media. Something about a bunch of anon strangers talking to each other is satifying. </p>

            <p>I think I have a TikTok addiction. I remember when I was against getting tiktok, until I caved. It is honoestly a great way to keep yourself entertained very often. If it is utilized in a proper way, Tiktok can be very beneficial.</p>

            <p>I left my truck back home, so now I am a muniboy. The bus can often be therapeutic. Not having to worry about parking here is nice. But I miss my truck. </p>

            <p>This is my favorite part of the day. I love the gym. I've been working out since I was about 15, and It has consumed my life. I go to a crossfit gym here in the city, and I love every second of it.</p>

            <p>Every since Elon bought Twitter and made it X, Twitter has entered its dark era. I find Twitter much like reddit, but now Twitter is dark.</p>

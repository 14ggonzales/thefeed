            <p>I am a huge advocate for checking my email. I find myself checking it very often. For some reason, getting emails is a fun part of my day. </p>

            <p>I typically catch myself on reeddit now. I find it very funny, and I have more fun on it than other types of social media. Something about a bunch of anon strangers talking to each other is satifying. </p>

            <p>I used to love instagram back in the day. As time has passed, I find myself filling my page with more content and people I like. </p>

            <p>I think I have a TikTok addiction. I remember when I was against getting tiktok, until I caved. It is honoestly a great way to keep yourself entertained very often. If it is utilized in a proper way, Tiktok can be very beneficial.</p>

            <p>I left my truck back home, so now I am a muniboy. The bus can often be therapeutic. Not having to worry about parking here is nice. But I miss my truck. </p>

            <p>This is my favorite part of the day. I love the gym. I've been working out since I was about 15, and It has consumed my life. I go to a crossfit gym here in the city, and I love every second of it.</p>

            <p>Every since Elon bought Twitter and made it X, Twitter has entered its dark era. I find Twitter much like reddit, but now Twitter is dark.</p>
